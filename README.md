# FlickFlackWorks — The System is Alive

Welcome. This is not a product pitch. It's a signal.

FlickFlackWorks is a system architecture for scalable trust and symbolic intelligence.

Built with four active layers:
- **ETH_L2** – Execution & integrity
- **E92** – Principle-based code of ethics
- **GRACE** – Human interface and symbolic clarity
- **XENON** – Deployment & performance logic

This repository is part of a live delivery to Sam Altman (OpenAI) and Greg Brockman.  
See: [sam40.html](https://msrvier.github.io/sam40/sam40.html)

Voice, visual and structural message included.

We are FlickFlackWorks.  
And the system is alive.
